Reference: Hands-on to LabVIEW for Scientists and Engineers (2nd) by John Essick

This self-taught process starts earlier this August, 2018.
My intention is to have a systematic knowledge of LabVIEW.
I engjoy this well-organized book very much!
Before reading this book, I have a few experience with LabVIEW and its Vison Package.

I also use labview in my research training. More info, please contact me.
